# STREAM-4D
Surface to Tractography Real-time EEG Activation Mapping in 4 Dimensions 

Verson 0.1.0

The initial release of this repository is meant to provide access to the techniques employed in "Visualizing Effective Connectivity in the Human Brain" - the preprint for which can be found at -----. Currently, this repository only supports the staging and data import to Blender with rendering done in a seperate step. Development is focused on fully automating the pipeline and allowing for headless Blender rendering to improve the accessibility of STREAM-4D.

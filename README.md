# STREAM-4D
Surface to Tractography Real-time EEG Activation Mapping in 4 Dimensions 

Verson 0.1.0

The initial release of this repository is meant to provide access to the techniques employed in ["Visualizing Effective Connectivity in the Human Brain"](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.06.641642). Currently, this code supports the staging and data import to Blender. Camera animation and rendering must be performed seperately. Development is focused on fully automating the pipeline and allowing for headless Blender rendering to improve the accessibility of the STREAM-4D technique.

Refer to help documentation of stream4d.py to get started with the pipeline.
